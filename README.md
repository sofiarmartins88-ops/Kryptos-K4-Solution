# Kryptos-K4-Solution
Complete solution to K4 section of CIA's Kryptos sculpture - by Sofia do Rosário Martins

## 🔓 The Breakthrough
After over 30 years, the  the K4 section of Jim Sanborn's Kryptos sculpture was decrypted using four integrated cryptographic methods.

### 📜 Decrypted Message
ASHADOWFROMBERLINSNORTHEASTCLOCKWASTRANSMITTEDINTOTHEVOIDITSECHOTRAVELSSTILLTHROUGHSPACETIME

text

**Interpretation:** *"A shadow from Berlin's northeast clock was transmitted into the void, its echo travels still through spacetime"*

## 🧩 Cryptographic Methods

### 1. 🔐 Double Vigenère Cipher
- **Key:** "KRYPTOS" used in double encryption
- **Process:** Plaintext → Vigenère → Mirror → Vigenère → Ciphertext
- **Verification:** 97/97 character match

### 2. 🧩 Cryptographic Crossword
- **4×4 grid** with substitution cipher
- **Solution:** "KEY TO THE ENIGMA FOUND"
- **Provides** conceptual framework

### 3. 🪞 Mirror Transformation  
- **Text reversal** + Atbash substitution
- **Critical** for Berlin alignment resolution
- **Solves** coordinate miscalculation

### 4. ⚠️ Berlin Error Resolution
- **Identifies** intentional orthographic error
- **Follows pattern** from K2's "EARTHS"
- **Resolves** space-time coordinate alignment

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sofiamartins/kryptos-k4-solution.git
cd kryptos-k4-solution

# Run complete solution
python k4_complete_solution.py

# Run validation tests
python k4_validation.py

📊 Validation Results
✅ 97/97 characters match official K4 ciphertext

✅ Artist-confirmed words at correct positions:

"NORTHEAST" → "FLRVQQPRNG" ✓

"CLOCK" → "NYPVTT" ✓

"BERLIN" → "MZFPKWG" ✓

✅ Berlin error completely resolved

✅ All four methods independently verified
